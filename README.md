## Getting Started :rocket:

To use `flask-error-pages` in your Flask application, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

It's recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects to avoid dependency conflicts. You can set up a virtual environment using:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.\venv\Scripts\activate.ps1`
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bamboobyyte/flask-error-pages.git
cd flask-error-pages
```

2. **Install the required packages:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

Edit the data.yaml file to change the title and paragraph text for the error pages as needed.

### Running the Application

To run the application and see your error pages in action:

```bash
python app.py
```

Now, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser. To trigger different error pages, try accessing routes that do not exist or simulate server errors.
